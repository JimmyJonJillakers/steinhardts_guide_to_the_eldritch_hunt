		<description>
			<p class="flavor">With a touch of gold, a breath of lightning, and hours of meticulous welding and articulation, a manikin is‘born’. Often called‘marionettes’ or‘living dolls’, these creatures were originally the creations of the Scions, a Luyarnhian sect who seek to craft a force capable of protecting the city. Though each manikin looks different—indeed, they can resemble any race—the thin golden stitching that joins the plates of their artificial skin is a giveaway that the creature is a manmade creation.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Free Will. </em></strong>. Inscribed on human eyes inside their skulls are the instructions which all manikin obey. More often than not, this includes a safety system that ensures adherence to the law and prevents a manikin turning on their master. In some cases, a crafter might even cause the manikin to feel love for their creator. Conceived as animate objects capable of carrying out the instructions, manikin who express thoughts of self-liberation are often disposed of before these thoughts turn into acts. Though the Scions intentions were initially noble, playing god has given them a taste for power and they have no intention of granting free will to their animated servants.</p>
			<h4>MANIKIN TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Constitution score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age. </em></strong>As they are not alive, Manikins do not age. However, their materials slowly lose their magic essence over time, meaning they will ultimately lose control over their entire body and turn back into inanimate objects.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type. </em></strong>You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a Construct for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a Construct.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size. </em></strong>Manikins can be small puppets or imposing armors. You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this race.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages. </em></strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and Deep Speech.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed. </em></strong>Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Born to Serve. </em></strong>Manikins are made to be unable to hate or resent their creators. This lapse in judgment affects you in all circumstances. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Lightning Heart. </em></strong>You have resistance to lightning damage.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Living Material. </em></strong>Manikins don't need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep. Instead they need only sit still for 8 hours, during which time they remain concious. After resting in this way, you gain the benefits of a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Modular Gold Plating. </em></strong>Your body has built-in defensive layers, which determine your armor class. You gain no AC benefit from wearing armor, but if you are using a shield, you apply its bonus as normal. Through 8 hours of work in a specialized workshop, you can alter your defensive layers to the Medium Armor or Heavy Armor options below, or back into your Unarmored state.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Prerequisite: Unarmored; AC=11 + your Dexterity modifier</li>
					<li>Prerequisite: Medium Armor proficiency; AC=13 + your Dexterity modifier (maximum of 2) or Strength modifier (maximum or 3). Choose which modifier when you gain this state.</li>
					<li>Prerequisite: Heavy Armor proficiency; AC=16 + your Strength modifier (maximum of 2).</li>
				</ul>
			<p>If you use your Strength modifier for AC, you have disadvantage on Stealth checks.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subraces. </em></strong>Manikins can be created for a variety of purposes, but they are mostly divided into three subraces: Custodian, Handler, and Thespian. Choose one of these subraces.</p>

		<supports>Manikin</supports>
		<description>
			<p>Custodians are built as an alternative to golems and commonly find use as butlers, laborers, and cannon fodder. Sentient beings, they are sworn to defend the person (or customer) for whom they were created. The death of their owner often leaves them aimless, wandering the world like masterless hedge knights in search of meaning.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Careful Defender. </em></strong>Designed to protect, you are adept at throwing yourself in the way of harm to shield others. When a creature within 5 feet of you is targeted by an attack, you can use your reaction to jump in front of it. If the creature is willing, you switch places with it, becoming the target of the attack instead. You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Powerful Build. </em></strong>You count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift.</p>

			<p class="flavor">Thespians are dolls often created in the image of a living being. Sometimes this is borne of innocent adoration. At others, it is the product of malicious obsession.</p>
			<p class="indent">Made to entertain, thespians bring joy to nobles, the clergy, and commoners alike. The only type of manikin designed without lethal intent, these manikins’ bodies are supported by invisible, intangible strings, allowing them to move seemingly in defiance of physics. As the plague has worsened, the Scions bent their will to producing manikins capable of combating the Scourge, and so the number of thespians has steadily dwindled.</p>
