			<p class="flavor">Easily distinguished by their eyes—brightly coloured irises that swirl like galaxies in a jet-black sclera— demidritch occupy a precarious precipice in the minds of Luyarnhians, equal parts revered and abhorred. Born of a union between humanoids and eldritch beings, demidritch are often referred to as‘half-angels’, a misnomer arising from Luyarnhians' mistaken belief that these creatures are descended from celestials. Stories abound of radiant silhouettes—eldritch creatures wreathed in powerful illusions—appearing unto pregnant Luyarnhians and blessing their progeny with otherworldly powers. While the Radiant Church espouses no stance on the morality of such beings, elements amongst their ranks, most notably the bookish Obitus Scholare, prize the demidritch as precious specimens that may provide the key to humanity's survival. The deeds of the righteous demidritch Aitzaz, a first hunter and close friend of Steinhardt, are widely recounted by bards and minstrels across the city. His death at the hands of the ravenous scourge while evacuating the schoolchildren of the Collegium Sancti Oculi precipitated a shift in the treatment of demidritch by Luyarnhians. Though they may have otherworldly origins, the alignment of demidritch, like most humanoids, is a product of their environment and upbringing</p>

			<p class="flavor">Also called observers, the many-eyed, and watchers, oculare always possess a greater allocation of eyes than one might expect. Commoners often describe the feeling of being watched when in the presence of oculare; in fact, such individuals commonly find themselves in the employ of the militia or church as investigators, their natural perceptiveness giving them a keen advantage.</p>

		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Beneath the translucent skin of the nebulare flit constellations of multihued lights: galaxy-like swirls and nebulous clouds. In times of great peril, these colourful displays can erupt in a supernova-like display of radiant brilliance, creating localised gravitational fields that help ensure the escape, and continued proliferation, of the nebular demidritch. Though the progenitor of the nebulare, an Outer God, has created no new nabulare for some time, the bloodline can go dormant for several generations, manifesting seemingly at random among newborns. Of course, with the Radiant Church experimentation in full swing, whether or not the recurrence of nebulare is really at random is an unanswered question.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase. </em></strong>Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Astral Attraction. </em></strong>Starting at 3rd level, you can use your action to unleash the potential energy within yourself, causing your body to erupt with power and transforming it for 1 minute. When you first transform, each creature other than you in a 10-foot radius centered on you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take a number of d6s of radiant damage from the explosion equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent">While transformed in this way, you shed bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You generate a powerful gravitational field. The area within a 20-foot radius centered on you is considered difficult terrain for creatures of your choice that you can see. Starting at level 12 the radius increases to 60 feet.</p>
