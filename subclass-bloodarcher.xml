		<description>
			<p>Blood archers are cursed beings that should not exist. Birthed from nightmarish experiments by the Obitus Scholare, these hunters use a cursed method of archery, weaving their own blood into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Their powers come from tarblood, an amalgamation of hundreds of species’ blood, which was forcefully injected in the veins of hunters. Those who didn’t die or go insane during the procedure became the first blood archers; only they and their descendants can wield this vicious power.</p>

			<p>At 3rd level, you learn to unleash special magical effects with some of your shots. When you gain this feature, you learn three Blood Shot options of your choice (see "Blood Shot Options'' below).</p>
			<p>Once per turn when you fire an arrow from a shortbow or longbow as part of the Attack action, you can apply one of your Blood Shot options to that arrow. You decide to use the option when the arrow hits, unless the option doesn’t involve an attack roll. You can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You gain an additional Blood Shot option of your choice when you reach certain levels in this class: 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level. Each option also improves when you become an 18th-level fighter.</p>

			<p>At 7th level, you gain the ability to create arrows with your blood. When you make a ranged attack using a shortbow or longbow, you can create a blood arrow in place of standard ammunition. Blood arrows are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>

		<description>
			<p>The Blood Shot feature lets you choose options for it at certain levels. The options are presented here in no specific order. They are all magical effects. Some of the Blood Shot features require your target to make a saving throw; the DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Blood Shot save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier</p>
			<h5>Bewitching Arrow</h5>
			<p>You infuse fey blood to cause this arrow to temporarily charm its target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you can choose one of the target's allies within 30 feet of it; the target now considers this ally as an enemy until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">The psychic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
			<h5>Bloodboil Arrow</h5>
			<p>Fiendish blood is infused in this devilish arrow that you fire. The arrow detonates in a cloud of ignited blood after your attack. Immediately after the arrow hits the creature, the target and all other creatures within 10 feet of it take 2d6 fire damage as their bodies start burning. This fire damage ignores resistance.</p>
			<p class="indent">The fire damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
			<h5>Bloodshard Arrow</h5>
			<p>You transform your arrow into a thread of sharp blood, which, instead of an attack roll, fires forward in a 1-foot wide, 30-foot long line, before disappearing. The arrow passes harmlessly through objects, ignoring cover. Each creature in that line must make a Dexterity saving throw or take damage as if it were hit by the arrow plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
			<h5>Constraining Arrow</h5>
			<p>When this arrow strikes its target, blood tainted by oozes creates grasping and sharp tendrils of blood, which wrap around the target. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 acid damage, its speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it takes 2d6 acid damage the first time on each turn it moves 1 foot or more without teleporting. A creature can use its action to make a Strength (Athletics) check against your Blood Shot save DC, removing the tendrils from itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Otherwise, the tendrils last for 1 minute or until you use this option again.</p>
			<p class="indent">Both acid damages increase to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
			<h5>Exiling Arrow</h5>
			<p>You use celestial blood to try to temporarily banish your target to a harmless location in the Celestial Plane. The creature hit by the arrow must also succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished. While banished in this way, its speed is 0 and it is incapacitated. At the end of its next turn, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.</p>
			<p class="indent">After you reach 18th level in this class, the target also takes 2d6 radiant damage when the arrow hits it.</p>
			<h5>Hunting Arrow</h5>
			<p>Using ancient bestial blood, you grant your arrow the ability to seek and hunt any foe, allowing the arrow to curve and twist its path in search of its prey. Instead of an attack roll, choose one creature you have seen in the past minute. The arrow flies toward that creature, moving around corners if necessary, and ignoring threequarters cover and half cover. If the target is within the weapon’s range and there is a path large enough for the arrow to travel to the target, the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes damage as if it were hit by the arrow plus an extra 1d6 piercing damage, and you learn the target’s current location.</p>
			<p class="indent">The piercing damage increases to 2d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
			<h5>Shadowblood Arrow</h5>
			<p>You weave threads of shadows from the blood of your foe, causing it to obscure the battlefield. The creature hit by the arrow takes an additional 2d6 necrotic damage and its blood forms a dark red mist that rises in a 10-foot radius around the target. This mist is magical darkness and spreads around corners. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and non magical light can't illuminate it. It lasts until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
			<h5>Thunderblood Arrow</h5>
			<p>You imbue your arrow with forceful energy drawn from the blood of giants. The arrow detonates immediately after it hits your target; the creature takes an additional 2d6 thunder damage and is pushed back 15 feet. In addition, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
			<p class="indent">The thunder damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
			<h5>Withering Arrow</h5>
			<p>You weave cursed undead blood into your arrow. The creature hit by the arrow takes an extra 2d6 necrotic damage. The target must also succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the damage dealt by its weapon attacks is halved until the start of your next turn.</p>
			<p class="indent">The necrotic damage increases to 4d6 when you reach 18th level in this class.</p>
