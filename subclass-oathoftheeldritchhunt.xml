		<supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The Oath of the Eldritch Hunt is sworn to the eradication of the unnatural, the aberrant, and the alien. These hunters tread a fine line, enhancing themselves with their preyâ€™s powers whilst trying to maintain their own sanity. Unfortunately, this frenzied hunger drives many to madness, and it is no rare occurrence for these paladins to have to hunt their own.</p>
			<p class="indent">This oath is found most frequently among paladins of the Radiant Church. Known as grey knights, witch hunters, and knights aberrant, these oft-deformed warriors devote themselves to obliterating the scourge and its creations.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">TENETS OF THE ELDRITCH HUNT</h5>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Resolve.</em></strong> Through willpower and tenacity, the strain of the hunt is endured; aching limbs and ailing minds are no reason to fall short.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Respect.</em></strong> Take life only when doing so protects others. Kill only when necessary, lest the bloodshed enamour your soul and hunter becomes beast.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Responsibility.</em></strong> Many rely on your talent to survive the moonlit nights. No matter the circumstances, do not fail them. Sacrifice your own body so that others can retain the sanctity of their own, untainted forms.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b><i>Hunt the Prey.</i></b> As a bonus action, you can call upon the sanctified hunt.
