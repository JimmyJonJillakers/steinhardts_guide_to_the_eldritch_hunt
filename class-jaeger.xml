		<description>
			<p class="indent">An unassuming human pounces in the night, his blade and revolver at the ready. A gunshot, followed by the sound of metal against flesh, and the splattering of blood over cobblestone. He snickers before plunging his blade anew into his battered prey.</p>
			<p class="indent">An elegant manikin vaults atop a maddened monster, before putting the barrel of her cannon against its skull, and pulling the trigger. She always loved explosions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Battleaxe in hand, a massive tiefling brutally decapitates a beast, then leaps towards another, plunging the silvered weapon in the creature’s chest and ripping a gashing wound from neck to groin.</p>
			<p class="indent">Jaegers are defined by their efficiency in battle, using their mastery over both steel and gunpowder to lay waste to all who oppose them. More than just soldiers, their skills represent the last wall of defense of a world fated to extinction; they are unstoppable and unbreakable. They strike fear in the heart of their foes, and bring hope to those they protect.</p>
			<h4>ENGINEERED PERFECTION</h4>
			<p>In the ease and safety that contemporary advancements bring, city dwellers frequently forget how fortunate their lives are. They have all but forgotten the life of pain that would befall them if the system failed. Which is precisely what took place in Luyarnha.</p>
			<p class="indent">The urbanites were left defenseless when the scourge swept the streets of the city, snapping like twigs in the face of such ferocity. While the denizens of the town struggled against insurmountable odds, the church and the nobility didn’t remain inert, instead, concentrating their efforts to engineer the ideal weapon, something capable of annihilating the beasts plaguing the city. This weapon came to be known as the jaegers.</p>
			<p class="indent">Jaegers thrive in the savagery of the hunt. They are capable of superhuman feats; their reflexes more honed than that of mere mortals, they are capable of dodging the most vicious of blows, and using that momentum to plunge their blade deep into the heart of their prey. A jaeger’s thirst for battle is endless - only in inaction can they experience fatigue. They are the perfect weapon against the nightmarish tides of beasts, and the sole reason Luyarnha still stands.</p>
			<h4>BONDS OF BLOOD</h4>
			<p>One who hunts beasts is a“hunter”, as they are commonly called by civilized society, but few hunters have the jaeger class. Bestowed powers beyond that of mere mortals, jaegers can come from any walk of life, having the appearance of any normal being, which allows them to blend in with crowds, only unleashing their abilities in times of need. They act as guardians for people who are unable to defend themselves, and they serve as the bloody sword of vengeance in a world that is hell-bent on destroying itself. Life in the city-state of Luyarnha is fraught with peril: gang warfare, infectious madness, and harrowing beasts. Amidst this chaos, jaegers are the first to charge into battle, so that their brothers and sisters can survive to live another day.</p>
			<p class="indent">Jaegers rarely leave their home city of Luyarnha - they would rather die than see it fall to the scourge. Following the jaeger's creed -'survive together, or die together'- they never hunt by themselves unless forced to. The nights can be brutal and the beasts are relentless; against such a ferocious onslaught, only a united front can hope to survive. As a result, jaegers are aware of the importance of teamwork and never charge into battle alone, save to retrieve fallen allies. The bonds formed during the hunts are stronger than those of many families. Blood is thicker than water, and the gods know that blood is shed when the hunt rages on.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A JAEGER</h4>
			<p>Think about the nature of your abilities and what gave rise to them as you construct your jaeger character. Were you one of the numerous orphans whose bodies were experimented on in the jaeger research project? Did you voluntarily join the ranks of hunters, or were you abducted and brainwashed into the ideal soldier? Alternatively, you might have defied the established order and joined the jaegers by a different route - perhaps after finding an eldritch carving and engraving it on your flesh. You might be self-taught - a loner who learned combat skills, tracking, or even a magical connection to the cosmos through the necessity of surviving the hunts. Instead, you might have learned from the comrades you now consider family.</p>
			<p class="indent">What fuels you? Is it a visceral hatred of the beasts that slaughtered your loved ones? Or is it a reflection of your desire to stop these monsters' devastation, committing yourself to reining in their carnage? Is your adventuring career a continuation of your work in annihilating the scourge of beasts, or a significant change? What made you join a band of adventurers? Do you enjoy the break from the hunt that new allies provide, or do you find it difficult to teach them the jaeger ways?</p>

		<supports>Jaeger Chapter</supports>
		<description>
			<p>The Heretic Chapter's jaegers are despised by both religious organizations and their adherents. In a world where acts of faith are required to harness divine powers, these jaegers instead rip these powers from the very gods, tearing away their divine fabric. Through blasphemous rituals, strange ingestions, and direct grafting of powers onto their souls, heretics bind the powers of greater beings to their will. This is a path that calls for a certain madness that is only found in the most ardent of hunters, those who feel the burning need to reach the pinnacle of power and will do anything to achieve it. Some seek such power for its own sake, but most want it to put an end to the nightmare.</p>
			<h4>HERETIC MAGIC</h4>
			<p>At 3rd level, you bend the dark powers of those you hunt to your service through blasphemous occult rituals, making them your own. You gain the ability to cast spells.</p>
			<h5>Cantrips</h5>
			<p>You learn two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn an additional warlock cantrip of your choice at 10th level.</p>
			<h5>Spell Slots</h5>
			<p>The Heretic Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have, as well as the level of those spell slots. All of your slots are of the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<h5>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h5>
			<p>At 3rd level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Heretic Spellcasting table shows when you learn a new spell of your choice from the warlock spell list. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast.</p>
			<h5>Spellcasting Ability</h5>
			<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, since you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier</p>

The DC of the save is 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus. The condition depends on the number of Momentum dice you have when you use this Finisher. You can choose to inflict a condition that requires fewer Momentum dice than you expend, but all Momentum dice are expended regardless of the condition selected.</description>

			<p class="indent">When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend all of your Momentum dice to rend a vicious bleeding wound. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it loses hit points equal to the number of Momentum dice expended. Each time it takes damage from this effect, the number of dice of damage it takes at the end of its next turn is reduced by 1, and the bleeding stops when the number of dice would be reduced to 0.</p>
			<p class="indent">Applying a new bleed while the target is still bleeding does not stack, but refreshes the number of dice of damage taken from the bleed to the higher of the two values.</p>

			<p class="indent">As a bonus action, you form one hand into a spectral beast claw and make a melee weapon attack with it, and expend all of your Momentum dice. On hit, the target takes slashing damage equal to 1d12 + your Strength modifier + 2 Momentum dice for each die expended. This attack has a higher critical hit range based on the number of Momentum dice expended, reducing the roll needed by 1 for each die, up to a maximum of scoring a critical hit on a 15-20 with 5 Momentum dice.</p>
